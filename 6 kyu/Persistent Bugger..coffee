# Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you 
# must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
# 
# For example (Input --> Output):
# 
# 39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
# 999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
# 4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)
# -----------------------------------------------------------

persistence = (n) ->
    answer = 0
    while n > 9
        newN = 1
        for i in n.toString()
            newN *= parseInt(i)
        n = newN
        answer += 1
    answer
