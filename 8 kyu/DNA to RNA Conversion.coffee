# Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine 
# ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').
# 
# Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In 
# RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').
# 
# Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
# 
# For example:
# 
# "GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
# 
# The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever 
# consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.
