# For a pole vaulter, it is very important to begin the approach run at the best possible starting mark. This is affected by numerous factors and requires 
# fine-tuning in practice. But there is a guideline that will help a beginning vaulter start at approximately the right location for the so-called "three-
# step approach," based on the vaulter's body height.
# 
# This guideline was taught to me in feet and inches, but due to the international nature of Codewars, I am creating this kata to use metric units 
# instead.
# 
# You are given the following two guidelines to begin with: (1) A vaulter with a height of 1.52 meters should start at 9.45 meters on the runway. (2) A 
# vaulter with a height of 1.83 meters should start at 10.67 meters on the runway.
# 
# You will receive a vaulter's height in meters (which will always lie in a range between a minimum of 1.22 meters and a maximum of 2.13 meters). 
# Your job is to return the best starting mark in meters, rounded to two decimal places.
# 
# Hint: Based on the two guidelines given above, you will want to account for the change in starting mark per change in body height. This involves a 
# linear relationship. (If you're not clear on that, search online for "linear equation.") But there is also a constant offset involved. If you can determine 
# the rate of change described above, you should be able to determine that constant offset.

startingMark = (bodyHeight) ->
    # Remember: Body height of 1.52 m --> starting mark: 9.45 m
    #           Body height of 1.83 m --> starting mark: 10.67 m
    # All other starting marks are based on these guidelines!
    a1 = 1.52
    b1 = 9.45
    a2 = 1.83
    b2 = 10.67
    x = (b2 - b1) / (a2 - a1)
    y = (a2 * b1 - a1 * b2) / (a2 - a1)
    answer = bodyHeight * x + y
    +answer.toFixed(2)
